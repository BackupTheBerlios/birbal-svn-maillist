+Outline for registration of births and deaths
+
+1. registration of both is done by the registrar with jurisdication over a
+particular area. This simplifies addresses as country, state, area can be
+coded in one place in config itself
+
+2. Record keeping is essential for transparency. So we cant just have a
+simple form to be added/edited, but have to lay an audit trail
+
+3. Both births and deaths the process starts with a report from and
+informant. The report may be in official form or in writing. It could also
+be over the web, telephone or by email or oral.
+
+4. Once a report is filed, a file is created. The report is then
+scrutinised for completeness, and if any particulars are missing it is
+returned for rectification.
+
+5. A returned report may not be resubmitted - in this event the file is
+closed and marked no further action
+
+6. when the report is complete, verification is done. A negative
+verification will also NFA the file - verification remark is added and file
+closed.
+
+7. The complete and verified report is then scrutinised and approved
+
+8. On approval the details of the report are entered into the register
+
+9. An application may be made to change or remove an entry in the register
+
+10. this application also goes through scrutiny, verification and approval
+
+11. Applications may be made for birth/death certificates. On verification,
+if the party is entitled to it, the certificate is issued on payment of the
+fee. Else it is refused and the application filed along with the remark
+
+12. Birth and death statistics can be generated.
